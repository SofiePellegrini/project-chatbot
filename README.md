# Project Name

Week 4 projec at Technigo Bootcamp. A pairproject where we were supposed to make a chatbot with Javascript. 
Made by Sofie Pellegrini and Jessica Sandler

## The problem

We started with planning the chatbot and what questions it would ask etc. After that our mainfocus was to understand the code and to get the chatbot to work. After that we continued with some styling. If we would have had more time we would have learned more about Javascript and made the chatbot more advanced but considering the time we had we're proud of the result.
